1. The date and time labels are swapped.

2. Using the find and repalce buffer:
';' was replaced with '\t' 
'\t\t' was replced with '\tNaN\t'
'( |\t)$' was replaced with ''
' ' was replaced with '_'
'^.*NaN.*$' was replaced with ''
'^\s\n' used to remove blank lines

3. sed -n '1p' Strdln_Twater_090611-090828_corrd.csv > 2009Measurements.txt was used to add the header of the three files to a new file.

grep -v '^M' "Strdln_Twater_090611-090828_corrd_sm.csv" "Strdln_Twater_090829-091012_corrd_sm.csv" "Strdln_Twater_091015-100602_corrd_sm.csv" >> 2009Measurements.txt
was used to pull all remaining data from the three files into the new file.

4. grep -v '^.*NaN.*' "2009Measurements.txt" >> completeLakeTemps.txt
used to take all data lines with out NaN in the data and copy them into a new file.

5.Used regex to replace year values of those DOY for the 01 and 15, then used grep -v command in terminal to create a new file with only those of replaced year value, returned the year values to thier original state using regex find and replace and saved the file.
